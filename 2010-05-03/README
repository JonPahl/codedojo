These are the files for the teams. The challenge for this meetup was 
set by Dan Shipton and we were to create a URL shortening service. We
had the following teams:

 1. David and Caleb
 2. Chuck and Matt
 3. Justin and Neil
 4. Adam and Karry (? please correct if i got this wrong)

Please add your code to the correct team folder and push to github
I'll merge the code into the main branch for future posterity.
