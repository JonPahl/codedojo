Here are the projects for the three groups. For each project, cd into the 
project folder and then run:

   bundle install

Once the depencies are satisified then run:

   rake db:migrate
   rails server

According to group 1 there are some Mac OS specific gems enabled to help 
with the unit tests. You may need to disable them to run these apps on 
different platforms.

group 1: url http://localhost:3000/tasks
group 2: url http://localhost:3000/
group 3: url http://localhost:3000/tasks
